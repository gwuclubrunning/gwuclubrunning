                        Apart from running I love to travel, explore in the outdoors, and dress up as a slug for the club halloween party. 
                        I can't wait to get to meet y'all and expand this lovely running community serving as your president. 
                        See ya out there!

                        I'm a sophomore majoring in History and minoring in French. 
                        I was born in Austin, Texas, the land of Buc-ee's and BBQ. 
                        My running journey started almost 10 years ago, and it has been an incredible experience. 
                        When I am not running, I enjoy exploring  D.C., visiting the Smithsonian Museums, and cooking delicious meals at home. 
                        These are some of my favorite pastimes here in D.C., and when I am back home, I love relaxing outside with my cats and chickens. 
                        I can't wait to see y'all at practice and I am looking forward to serving as your vice president!

                        I am so excited to be your treasurer this semester and run with everyone. 
                        Outside of running I love taking walks, reading, spending time with friends, singing and visiting museums.

                        I am a junior studying Exercise Science with a Pre-PT concentration. 
                        I'm originally from right outside of Boston, MA and I've been running since my freshman year in high school. 
                        Besides running, I love to ride, bike, and cook soup (my favorite so far is chicken and gnocchi). 
                        I also work at Pacers (running store) on 14th street, so let me know if you need the latest on running shoes and the like. 
                        I'm super excited to get to know everyone and plan some super cool events!

                        I'm a Junior here at GW, studying Public Health and Emergency Health Services. 
                        The photo above? It's close to my heart. As a kid, Night at the Museum was one of my favorite movies and made me love history and storytelling. 
                        I would die to aimlessly wander an empty natural history museum effortlessly learning in immersive ways just like the movie. 
                        When I'm not out running, I'm either exploring new places or playing tennis with the club team on campus. 
                        I am super excited to be serving as your PR Director this year and look forward to engaging with you all in person and through social media.

                        You can usually find me doing repeats around Hains Point or getting some easy mileage around nature in Rock Creek Park. 
                        I've run four marathons already and as TPC my goal is to help as many people as possible run one! 
                        I would love to tell you all about my life outside of running but this is my whole personality and I hope that eventually it becomes yours too! 
                        I'm very excited to help the team train to crush all their goals this season.

                        When I'm not running you can find me baking, exploring DC, or doing anything outdoors if it's above 5o degrees.

                        Hey! My name is Setareh (she/her) and I am from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. 
                        I'm a freshman majoring in business with a concentration in business economics and public policy. 
                        I have been running for 5 years now. 
                        And while I definitely love it, when I'm not running I love baking/cooking, going on walks to new places, exploring different farmers markets with friends, and catching up on sleep. 
                        I look forward to being a run captain this year and getting to know the team!

                        Hey everyone! My name is Katy (she/her) and I am from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. 
                        I'm a freshman majoring in data science with a concentration in biology: biodiversity and global change. 
                        I ran track and cross country in high school and fell in love with the sport! 
                        When I'm not running you can find me trying new coffee shops, exploring DC, or stalking my favorite running influencers. 
                        One of my running superstitions is eating a banana on race day, so, as you can see in this picture, I bought myself a beautiful pair of banana ChicknLegs shorts (complementary with the GW club running merch). 
                        I am so excited to be a run captain this year since I love meeting new people and connecting with the team!
